sway-bar - bar configuration file and commands
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Sway allows configuring swaybar in the sway configuration file.\&
.P
.SH COMMANDS
.P
The following commands may only be used in the configuration file.\&
.P
\fBid\fR <bar_id>
.RS 4
Sets the ID of the bar.\&
.P
.RE
\fBswaybar_command\fR <command>
.RS 4
Executes custom bar command.\& Default is \fIswaybar\fR.\&
.P
.RE
The following commands may be used either in the configuration file or at
runtime.\&
.P
\fBbindcode\fR [--release] <event-code> <command>
.RS 4
Executes \fIcommand\fR when the mouse button has been pressed (or if \fIreleased\fR
is given, when the button has been released).\& The buttons can be given as
an event code, which can be obtaining from \fBlibinput debug-events\fR.\& To
disable the default behavior for a button, use the command \fInop\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fBbindsym\fR [--release] button[1-9]|<event-name> <command>
.RS 4
Executes \fIcommand\fR when the mouse button has been pressed (or if \fIreleased\fR
is given, when the button has been released).\& The buttons can be given as a
x11 button number or an event name, which can be obtained from \fBlibinput
debug-events\fR.\& To disable the default behavior for a button, use the
command \fInop\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fBbinding_mode_indicator\fR yes|no
.RS 4
Enable or disable binding mode indicator.\& Default is \fIyes\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fBfont\fR <font>
.RS 4
Specifies the font to be used in the bar.\& \fIfont\fR should be specified as a
pango font description.\& For more information on pango font descriptions,
see https://docs.\&gtk.\&org/Pango/type_func.\&FontDescription.\&from_string.\&html#description
.P
.RE
\fBgaps\fR <all> | <horizontal> <vertical> | <top> <right> <bottom> <left>
.RS 4
Sets the gaps from the edge of the screen for the bar.\& Gaps can either be
set all at once, per direction, or per side.\& Note that only sides that
touch an edge of the screen can have gaps.\& For the side that does not
touch an edge of the screen, per-side outer gaps for workspaces may be of
use.\&
.P
.RE
\fBheight\fR <height>
.RS 4
Sets the height of the bar.\& Default height (0) will match the font size.\&
.P
.RE
\fBhidden_state\fR hide|show [<bar-id>]
.RS 4
Specifies the behaviour of the bar when it is in \fIhide\fR mode.\& When the
hidden state is \fIhide\fR, then it is normally hidden, and only unhidden by
pressing the modifier key or in case of urgency hints.\& When the hidden
state is \fIshow\fR, then it is permanently visible, drawn on top of the
currently visible workspace.\& Default is \fIhide\fR.\&
.P
For compatibility with i3, \fIbar hidden_state hide|show [<bar-id>]\fR is
supported along with the sway only \fIbar <bar-id> hidden_state hide|show\fR
syntax.\& When using the i3 syntax, if \fIbar-id\fR is omitted, the hidden_state
will be changed for all bars.\& Attempting to use \fIbar <bar-id1>
hidden_state hide|show <bar-id2>\fR will result in an error due to
conflicting bar ids.\&
.P
.RE
\fBmode\fR dock|hide|invisible|overlay [<bar-id>]
.RS 4
Specifies the visibility of the bar.\& In \fIdock\fR mode, it is permanently
visible at one edge of the screen.\& In \fIhide\fR mode, it is hidden unless the
modifier key is pressed, though this behaviour depends on the hidden state.\&
In \fIinvisible\fR mode, it is permanently hidden.\& In \fIoverlay\fR mode, it is
permanently visible on top of other windows.\& (In \fIoverlay\fR mode the bar is
transparent to input events.\&) Default is \fIdock\fR.\&
.P
For compatibility with i3, \fIbar mode <mode> [<bar-id>]\fR syntax is supported
along with the sway only \fIbar <bar-id> mode <mode>\fR syntax.\& When using the
i3 syntax, if \fIbar-id\fR is omitted, the mode will be changed for all bars.\&
Attempting to use \fIbar <bar-id1> mode <mode> <bar-id2>\fR will result in an
error due to conflicting bar ids.\&
.P
.RE
\fBmodifier\fR <Modifier>|none
.RS 4
Specifies the modifier key that shows a hidden bar.\& Default is \fIMod4\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fBoutput\fR <output>|*
.RS 4
Restrict the bar to a certain output, can be specified multiple times.\& If
the output command is omitted, the bar will be displayed on all outputs.\& \fI*\fR
can be given at any point to reset it back to all outputs.\&
.P
.RE
\fBpango_markup\fR enabled|disabled
.RS 4
Enables or disables pango markup for status lines.\& This has no effect on
status lines using the i3bar JSON protocol.\&
.P
.RE
\fBposition\fR top|bottom
.RS 4
Sets position of the bar.\& Default is \fIbottom\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fBseparator_symbol\fR <symbol>
.RS 4
Specifies the separator symbol to separate blocks on the bar.\&
.P
.RE
\fBstatus_command\fR <status command>
.RS 4
Executes the bar \fIstatus command\fR with \fIsh -c\fR.\& Each line of text printed
to stdout from this command will be displayed in the status area of the
bar.\& You may also use swaybar'\&s JSON status line protocol.\& See
\fBswaybar-protocol\fR(7) for more information on the protocol
.P
If running this command via IPC, you can disable a running status command by
setting the command to a single dash: \fIswaybar bar bar-0 status_command -\fR
.P
.RE
\fBstatus_edge_padding\fR <padding>
.RS 4
Sets the padding that is used when the status line is at the right edge of
the bar.\& This value will be multiplied by the output scale.\& The default is
\fI3\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fBstatus_padding\fR <padding>
.RS 4
Sets the vertical padding that is used for the status line.\& The default is
\fI1\fR.\& If \fIpadding\fR is \fI0\fR, blocks will be able to take up the full height of
the bar.\& This value will be multiplied by the output scale.\&
.P
.RE
\fBstrip_workspace_name\fR yes|no
.RS 4
If set to \fIyes\fR, then workspace names will be omitted from the workspace
button and only the custom number will be shown.\& Default is \fIno\fR.\&

.P
.RE
.SS TRAY
.P
Swaybar provides a system tray where third-party applications may place icons.\&
The following commands configure the tray.\&
.P
\fBtray_bindcode\fR <event-code>
ContextMenu|Activate|SecondaryActivate|ScrollDown|ScrollLeft|ScrollRight|ScrollUp|nop

To disable the default behavior for a button, use the command \fInop\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fBtray_bindsym\fR button[1-9]|<event-name>
ContextMenu|Activate|SecondaryActivate|ScrollDown|ScrollLeft|ScrollRight|ScrollUp|nop
.RS 4
Executes the action when the mouse button has been pressed.\& The buttons can
be given as a x11 button number or an event name, which can be obtained

action (Activate for button1, ContextMenu for button2 and SecondaryActivate
for button3).\&
.P
.RE
\fBtray_padding\fR <px> [px]
.RS 4

given at any point to reset it to display on all outputs.\&
.P
.RE
\fBicon_theme\fR <name>
.RS 4

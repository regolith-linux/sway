sway-input - input configuration file and commands
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Sway allows for configuration of devices within the sway configuration file.\&
To obtain a list of available device identifiers, run \fBswaymsg -t get_inputs\fR.\&
Settings can also be applied to all input devices by using the wildcard, \fI*\fR,
in place of \fI<identifier>\fR in the commands below.\& In addition, the settings
can be applied to a type of device, by using \fItype:<input_type>\fR in place
of \fI<identifier>\fR.\&
.P
In the configuration file, settings with a more specific selector take
precedence over more general ones: \fI<identifier>\fR > \fItype:<input_type>\fR >
\fI*\fR.\&  When executing input commands, however, the settings are applied to all
matching input devices!\&  This means that \fItype:<input_type>\fR can override
previously set \fI<identifier>\fR settings, even though in a configuration file
they would take precedence.\&  Similarly \fI*\fR can override both \fI<identifier>\fR
and \fItype:<input_type>\fR settings, if applied later.\&
.P
Tip: If the configuration settings do not appear to be taking effect, you could
try using \fI*\fR instead of \fI<identifier>\fR.\& If it works with the wildcard, try
using a different identifier from \fBswaymsg -t get_inputs\fR until you find the
correct input device.\&

Current available input types are:

layout.\&
.P
.RE
\fBinput\fR <identifier> map_to_region <X> <Y> <width> <height>
.RS 4
Maps inputs from this device to the specified region of the global output
layout.\& Only meaningful if the device is a pointer, touch, or drawing tablet
device.\&
.P
.RE
\fBinput\fR <identifier> map_from_region <X1xY1> <X2xY2>
.RS 4
Ignores inputs from this device that do not occur within the specified
region.\& Can be in millimeters (e.\&g.\& 10x20mm 20x40mm) or in terms of 0.\&.\&1
(e.\&g.\& 0.\&5x0.\&5 0.\&7x0.\&7).\& Not all devices support millimeters.\& Only meaningful
if the device is not a keyboard and provides events in absolute terms (such
as a drawing tablet or touch screen - most pointers provide events relative
to the previous frame).\&

.RS 4
Enables or disables send_events for specified input device.\& Disabling
send_events disables the input device.\&
.P
The \fItoggle\fR option cannot be used in the config.\& If no toggle modes are
listed, all supported modes for the device will be toggled through in the
order: enabled,	disabled_on_external_mouse, disabled, (loop back).\& If
toggle modes are listed, they will be cycled through, defaulting to the
first mode listed if the current mode is not in the list.\& They will also
not be checked to see if they are supported for the device and may fail.\&
.P

.RE
.SS SEAT CONFIGURATION
.P
Configure options for multiseat mode.\&
.P
A \fBseat\fR is a collection of input devices that act independently of each other.\&
Seats are identified by name and the default seat is \fIseat0\fR if no seats are
configured.\& While sway is running, \fI-\fR (hyphen) can be used as an alias for the
current seat.\& Each seat has an independent keyboard focus and a separate cursor
that is controlled by the pointer devices of the seat.\& This is useful for
multiple people using the desktop at the same time with their own devices (each
sitting in their own "seat").\& The wildcard character, \fI*\fR, can also be used in
place of \fI<identifier>\fR to change settings for all seats.\&
.P
Tip: If the configuration settings do not appear to be taking effect, you could
try using \fI*\fR instead of \fI<identifier>\fR.\& If it works with the wildcard, try
using a different identifier from \fBswaymsg -t get_seats\fR until you find the
correct seat.\&
.P
\fBseat\fR <name> attach <input_identifier>
.RS 4
Attach an input device to this seat by its input identifier.\& A special
value of "*" will attach all devices to the seat.\&
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <seat> cursor move|set <x> <y>
.RS 4
Move specified seat'\&s cursor relative to current position or wrap to
absolute coordinates (with respect to the global coordinate space).\&
Specifying either value as 0 will not update that coordinate.\&
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <seat> cursor press|release button[1-9]|<event-name-or-code>
.RS 4
Simulate pressing (or releasing) the specified mouse button on the
specified seat.\& The button can either be provided as a button event name or
event code, which can be obtained from \fBlibinput debug-events\fR, or as an x11
mouse button (button[1-9]).\& If using button[4-7], which map to axes, an axis
event will be simulated, however \fIpress\fR and \fIrelease\fR will be ignored and
both will occur.\&
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> fallback true|false
.RS 4
Set this seat as the fallback seat.\& A fallback seat will attach any device
not explicitly attached to another seat (similar to a "default" seat).\&
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> hide_cursor <timeout>|when-typing [enable|disable]
.RS 4
Hides the cursor image after the specified event occurred.\&
.P
If \fItimeout\fR is specified, then the cursor will be hidden after \fItimeout\fR
(in milliseconds) has elapsed with no activity on the cursor.\& A timeout of 0
(default) disables hiding the cursor.\& The minimal timeout is 100 and any
value less than that (aside from 0), will be increased to 100.\&
.P
If \fIwhen-typing\fR is enabled, then the cursor will be hidden whenever a key
is pressed.\&
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> idle_inhibit <sources.\&.\&.\&>
.RS 4
Sets the set of input event sources which can prevent the seat from
becoming idle, as a space separated list of source names.\& Valid names are
"keyboard", "pointer", "touchpad", "touch", "tablet_pad", "tablet_tool",
and "switch".\& The default behavior is to prevent idle on any event.\&
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> idle_wake <sources.\&.\&.\&>
.RS 4
Sets the set of input event sources which can wake the seat from
its idle state, as a space separated list of source names.\& Valid names are
"keyboard", "pointer", "touchpad", "touch", "tablet_pad", "tablet_tool",
and "switch".\& The default behavior is to wake from idle on any event.\&
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> keyboard_grouping none|smart
.RS 4
Set how the keyboards in the seat are grouped together.\& Currently, there
are two options.\& \fInone\fR will disable all keyboard grouping.\& This will make
it so each keyboard device has its own isolated state.\& \fIsmart\fR will
group the keyboards in the seat by their keymap and repeat info.\& This is
useful for when the keyboard appears as multiple separate input devices.\&
In this mode, the effective layout is synced between the keyboards in the
group.\& The default is \fIsmart\fR.\& To restore the behavior of older versions
of sway, use \fInone\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> pointer_constraint enable|disable|escape
.RS 4
Enables or disables the ability for clients to capture the cursor (enabled
by default) for the seat.\& This is primarily useful for video games.\& The
"escape" command can be used at runtime to escape from a captured client.\&
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> shortcuts_inhibitor enable|disable|activate|deactivate|toggle
.RS 4
Enables or disables the ability of clients to inhibit keyboard
shortcuts for the seat.\& This is primarily useful for virtualization and
remote desktop software.\& Subcommands \fIenable\fR and \fIdisable\fR affect
whether future inhibitors are honoured by default, i.\&e.\& activated
automatically, the default being \fIenable\fR.\& When used at runtime,
\fIdisable\fR also disables any currently active inhibitors.\& \fIactivate\fR,
\fIdeactivate\fR and \fItoggle\fR are only usable at runtime and change the
state of a potentially existing inhibitor on the currently focused
window.\& This can be used with the current seat alias (\fI-\fR) to affect
only the currently focused window of the current seat.\& Subcommand
\fIdeactivate\fR is particularly useful in an \fI--inhibited\fR \fBbindsym\fR to
escape a state where shortcuts are inhibited and the client becomes
uncooperative.\& It is worth noting that whether disabled or deactivated
inhibitors are removed is entirely up to the client.\& Depending on the
client it may therefore be possible to (re-)activate them later.\& Any
visual indication that an inhibitor is present is currently left to the
client as well.\&
.P
.RE
\fBseat\fR <name> xcursor_theme <theme> [<size>]
.RS 4
Override the system default XCursor theme.\& The default seat'\&s
(\fIseat0\fR) theme is also used as the default cursor theme in
XWayland, and exported through the \fIXCURSOR_THEME\fR and
\fIXCURSOR_SIZE\fR environment variables.\&

sway - configuration file and commands
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
A sway configuration file is a list of sway commands that are executed by sway
on startup.\&  These commands usually consist of setting your preferences and
setting key bindings.\& An example config is likely present in /etc/sway/config
for you to check out.\&
.P
Lines in the configuration file might be extended through multiple lines by
adding a '\&\\'\& character at the end of line.\& e.\&g.\&:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
bindsym Shift+XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec \\
	pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -1%
.fi
.RE
.P
Commands can also be given as a block in the form \fBcommand { <subcommands.\&.\&.\&>
}\fR.\& Anything before the opening \fB{\fR will be prepended to the lines inside the
block.\& For example:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
output eDP-1 {
	background ~/wallpaper\&.png fill
	resolution 1920x1080
}
.fi
.RE
.P
is identical to
.P
.nf
.RS 4
output eDP-1 background ~/wallpaper\&.png fill
output eDP-1 resolution 1920x1080
.fi
.RE
.P
These commands can be executed in your config file, via \fBswaymsg\fR(1), or via
the bindsym command.\&
.P
.SH COMMAND CONVENTIONS
.P
Commands are split into several arguments using spaces.\& You can enclose
arguments with quotation marks (\fB".\&.\&.\&"\fR or \fB'\&.\&.\&.\&'\&\fR) to add spaces to a single
argument.\& You may also run several commands in order by separating each with
\fB,\fR or \fB;\fR.\& Criteria is retained across commands separated by \fB,\fR, but will be
reset (and allow for new criteria, if desired) for commands separated by a \fB;\fR.\&
.P
Throughout the documentation, \fB|\fR is used to distinguish between arguments for
which you may only select one.\& \fB[.\&.\&.\&]\fR is used for optional arguments, and
\fB<.\&.\&.\&>\fR for arguments where you are expected to supply some value.\&
.P
.SH COMMANDS
.P
This section only lists general commands.\& For input and output commands, refer
to \fBsway-input\fR(5) and \fBsway-output\fR(5).\&
.P
The following commands may only be used in the configuration file.\&
.P
\fBbar\fR [<bar-id>] <bar-subcommands.\&.\&.\&>
.RS 4
For details on bar subcommands, see \fBsway-bar\fR(5).\&
.P
.RE
\fBdefault_orientation\fR horizontal|vertical|auto
.RS 4
Sets the default container layout for tiled containers.\&
.P
.RE
\fBinclude\fR <path>
.RS 4
Includes another file from \fIpath\fR.\& \fIpath\fR can be either a full path or a
path relative to the parent config, and expands shell syntax (see
\fBwordexp\fR(3) for details).\& The same include file can only be included once;
subsequent attempts will be ignored.\&
.P
.RE
\fBswaybg_command\fR <command>
.RS 4
Executes custom background \fIcommand\fR.\& Default is \fIswaybg\fR.\& Refer to
\fBsway-output\fR(5) for more information.\&
.P
It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash:
\fIswaybg_command -\fR
.P
.RE
\fBswaynag_command\fR <command>
.RS 4
Executes custom command for \fIswaynag\fR.\& Default is \fIswaynag\fR.\& Additional
arguments may be appended to the end.\& This should only be used to either
direct sway to call swaynag from a custom path or to provide additional
arguments.\& This should be placed at the top of the config for the best
results.\&
.P
It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash:
\fIswaynag_command -\fR
.P
.RE
\fBworkspace_layout\fR default|stacking|tabbed
.RS 4
Specifies the initial layout for new containers in an empty workspace.\&
.P
.RE
\fBxwayland\fR enable|disable|force
.RS 4
Enables or disables Xwayland support, which allows X11 applications to be
used.\& \fIenable\fR will lazily load Xwayland so Xwayland will not be launched
until the first client attempts to connect.\& In some cases, such as slower
machines, it may be desirable to have Xwayland started immediately by
using \fIforce\fR instead of \fIenable\fR.\&
.P
.RE
The following commands cannot be used directly in the configuration file.\&
They are expected to be used with \fBbindsym\fR or at runtime through \fBswaymsg\fR(1).\&
.P
\fBborder\fR none|normal|csd|pixel [<n>]
.RS 4
Set border style for focused window.\& \fInormal\fR includes a border of
thickness \fIn\fR and a title bar.\& \fIpixel\fR is a border without title bar \fIn\fR
pixels thick.\& Default is \fInormal\fR with border thickness 2.\& \fIcsd\fR is short
for client-side-decorations, which allows the client to draw its own
decorations.\&
.P
.RE
\fBborder\fR toggle
.RS 4
Cycles through the available border styles.\&
.P
.RE
\fBexit\fR
.RS 4
Exit sway and end your Wayland session.\&
.P
.RE
\fBfloating\fR enable|disable|toggle
.RS 4
Make focused view floating, non-floating, or the opposite of what it is now.\&
.P
.RE

.RE
\fBfocus\fR up|right|down|left
.RS 4
Moves focus to the next container in the specified direction.\&
.P
.RE
\fBfocus\fR prev|next [sibling]
.RS 4
Moves focus to the previous or next container in the current layout.\& By default,
the last active child of the newly focused container will be focused.\& The \fIsibling\fR
option indicates not to immediately focus a child of the container.\&
.P
.RE
\fBfocus\fR child

.P
.RE
\fBfocus\fR mode_toggle
.RS 4
Moves focus between the floating and tiled layers.\&
.P
.RE
\fBfullscreen\fR [enable|disable|toggle] [global]
.RS 4
Makes focused view fullscreen, non-fullscreen, or the opposite of what it
is now.\& If no argument is given, it does the same as \fItoggle\fR.\& If \fIglobal\fR
is specified, the view will be fullscreen across all outputs.\&
.P
.RE
\fBgaps\fR inner|outer|horizontal|vertical|top|right|bottom|left all|current
set|plus|minus|toggle <amount>
.RS 4
Changes the \fIinner\fR or \fIouter\fR gaps for either \fIall\fR workspaces or the
\fIcurrent\fR workspace.\& \fIouter\fR gaps can be altered per side with \fItop\fR,
\fIright\fR, \fIbottom\fR, and \fIleft\fR or per direction with \fIhorizontal\fR and
\fIvertical\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fBinhibit_idle\fR focus|fullscreen|open|none|visible
.RS 4
Set/unset an idle inhibitor for the view.\& \fIfocus\fR will inhibit idle when
the view is focused by any seat.\& \fIfullscreen\fR will inhibit idle when the
view is fullscreen (or a descendant of a fullscreen container) and is
visible.\& \fIopen\fR will inhibit idle until the view is closed (or the
inhibitor is unset/changed).\& \fIvisible\fR will inhibit idle when the view is
visible on any output.\& \fInone\fR will remove any existing idle inhibitor for
the view.\&
.P
This can also be used with criteria to set an idle inhibitor for any
existing view or with \fIfor_window\fR to set idle inhibitors for future views.\&
.P
.RE
\fBlayout\fR default|splith|splitv|stacking|tabbed
.RS 4
Sets the layout mode of the focused container.\&
.P
.RE
\fBlayout\fR toggle [split|all]
.RS 4
Cycles the layout mode of the focused container though a preset list of
layouts.\& If no argument is given, then it cycles through stacking, tabbed
and the last split layout.\& If \fIsplit\fR is given, then it cycles through
splith and splitv.\& If \fIall\fR is given, then it cycles through every layout.\&
.P
.RE
\fBlayout\fR toggle [split|tabbed|stacking|splitv|splith] [split|tabbed|stacking|splitv|splith].\&.\&.\&
.RS 4
Cycles the layout mode of the focused container through a list of layouts.\&
.P
.RE
\fBmax_render_time\fR off|<msec>
.RS 4
Controls when the relevant application is told to render this window, as a
positive number of milliseconds before the next time sway composites the
output.\& A smaller number leads to fresher rendered frames being composited
by sway and lower perceived input latency, but if set too low, the
application may not finish rendering before sway composites the output,
leading to delayed frames.\&
.P
When set to off, the relevant application is told to render this window
immediately after display refresh.\& How much time is left for rendering
before sway composites the output at that point depends on the output
\fBmax_render_time\fR setting.\&
.P
To set this up for optimal latency:
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'1.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 1. 4
.\}
Set up \fBoutput max_render_time\fR (see \fBsway-output\fR(5)).\&
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'2.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 2. 4
.\}
Put the target application in \fIfull-screen\fR and have it continuously
render something.\&
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'3.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 3. 4
.\}
Start by setting \fBmax_render_time 1\fR.\& If the application drops
frames, increment by \fB1\fR.\&

.RE
.P
This setting only has an effect if a per-output \fBmax_render_time\fR is in
effect on the output the window is currently on.\& See \fBsway-output\fR(5) for
further details.\&
.P
.RE
\fBmove\fR left|right|up|down [<px> px]
.RS 4
Moves the focused container in the direction specified.\& If the container,
the optional \fIpx\fR argument specifies how many pixels to move the container.\&
If unspecified, the default is 10 pixels.\& Pixels are ignored when moving
tiled containers.\&
.P
.RE
\fBmove\fR [absolute] position <pos_x> [px|ppt] <pos_y> [px|ppt]
.RS 4
Moves the focused container to the specified position in the workspace.\&
The position can be specified in pixels or percentage points, omitting
the unit defaults to pixels.\& If	\fIabsolute\fR is used, the position is
relative to all outputs.\& \fIabsolute\fR can not be used with percentage points.\&
.P
.RE
\fBmove\fR [absolute] position center

remote desktop software.\& It affects either the currently focused view
or a set of views selected by criteria.\& Subcommand \fIdisable\fR
additionally deactivates any active inhibitors for the given view(s).\&

\fBswap\fR container with id|con_id|mark <arg>
.RS 4
Swaps the position, geometry, and fullscreen status of two containers.\& The
first container can be selected either by criteria or focus.\& The second
container can be selected by \fIid\fR, \fIcon_id\fR, or \fImark\fR.\& \fIid\fR can only be
used with xwayland views.\& If the first container has focus, it will retain
focus unless it is moved to a different workspace or the second container
becomes fullscreen on the same workspace as the first container.\& In either
of those cases, the second container will gain focus.\&

[--to-code] [--input-device=<device>] [--no-warn] [--no-repeat] [Group<1-4>+]<key combo> 
<command>
.RS 4
Binds \fIkey combo\fR to execute the sway command \fIcommand\fR when pressed.\& You
may use XKB key names here (\fBwev\fR(1) is a good tool for discovering these).\&
With the flag \fI--release\fR, the command is executed when the key combo is
released.\& If \fIinput-device\fR is given, the binding will only be executed for
that input device and will be executed instead of any binding that is
generic to all devices.\& If a group number is given, then the binding will
only be available for that group.\& By default, if you overwrite a binding,
swaynag will give you a warning.\& To silence this, use the \fI--no-warn\fR flag.\&
.P
Unless the flag \fI--locked\fR is set, the command will not be run when a
screen locking program is active.\& If there is a matching binding with
and without \fI--locked\fR, the one with will be preferred when locked and the
one without will be preferred when unlocked.\& If there are matching bindings
and one has both \fI--input-device\fR and \fI--locked\fR and the other has neither,
the former will be preferred even when unlocked.\&
.P
Unless the flag \fI--inhibited\fR is set, the command will not be run when
a keyboard shortcuts inhibitor is active for the currently focused
window.\& Such inhibitors are usually requested by remote desktop and
virtualization software to enable the user to send keyboard shortcuts
to the remote or virtual session.\& The \fI--inhibited\fR flag allows one to
define bindings which will be exempt from pass-through to such
software.\& The same preference logic as for \fI--locked\fR applies.\&
.P
Unless the flag \fI--no-repeat\fR is set, the command will be run
repeatedly when the key is held, according to the repeat
settings specified in the input configuration.\&
.P
Bindings to keysyms are layout-dependent.\& This can be changed with the
\fI--to-code\fR flag.\& In this case, the keysyms will be translated into the
corresponding keycodes in the first configured layout.\&
.P
Mouse bindings operate on the container under the cursor instead of the
container that has focus.\& Mouse buttons can either be specified in the form
\fIbutton[1-9]\fR or by using the name of the event code (ex \fIBTN_LEFT\fR or
\fIBTN_RIGHT\fR).\& For the former option, the buttons will be mapped to their
values in X11 (1=left, 2=middle, 3=right, 4=scroll up, 5=scroll down,
6=scroll left, 7=scroll right, 8=back, 9=forward).\& For the latter option,
you can find the event names using \fIlibinput debug-events\fR.\&
.P
The priority for matching bindings is as follows: input device, group,
and locked state.\&
.P
\fI--whole-window\fR, \fI--border\fR, and \fI--exclude-titlebar\fR are mouse-only options
which affect the region in which the mouse bindings can be triggered.\&  By
default, mouse bindings are only triggered when over the title bar.\& With the
\fI--border\fR option, the border of the window will be included in this region.\&
With the \fI--whole-window\fR option, the cursor can be anywhere over a window
including the title, border, and content.\& \fI--exclude-titlebar\fR can be used in
conjunction with any other option to specify that the titlebar should be
excluded from the region of consideration.\&
.P
If \fI--whole-window\fR is given, the command can be triggered when the cursor
is over an empty workspace.\& Using a mouse binding over a layer surface'\&s
exclusive region is not currently possible.\&

\fBbindswitch\fR [--locked] [--no-warn] [--reload] <switch>:<state> <command>
.RS 4
Binds <switch> to execute the sway command \fIcommand\fR on state changes.\&
Supported switches are \fIlid\fR (laptop lid) and \fItablet\fR (tablet mode)
switches.\& Valid values for \fIstate\fR are \fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR and \fItoggle\fR.\& These
switches are on when the device lid is shut and when tablet mode is active
respectively.\& \fItoggle\fR is also supported to run a command both when the
switch is toggled on or off.\&
.P
Unless the flag \fI--locked\fR is set, the command will not be run when a
screen locking program is active.\& If there is a matching binding with
and without \fI--locked\fR, the one with will be preferred when locked and the
one without will be preferred when unlocked.\&
.P
If the \fI--reload\fR flag is given, the binding will also be executed when
the config is reloaded.\& \fItoggle\fR bindings will not be executed on reload.\&
The \fI--locked\fR flag will operate as normal so if the config is reloaded
while locked and \fI--locked\fR is not given, the binding will not be executed.\&
.P
By default, if you overwrite a binding, swaynag will give you a warning.\& To
silence this, use the \fI--no-warn\fR flag.\&

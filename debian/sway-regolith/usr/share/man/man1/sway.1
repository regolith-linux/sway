.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
sway was created to fill the need of an i3-like window manager for Wayland.\& The
upstream i3 developers have no intention of porting i3 to Wayland, and projects
proposed by others ended up as vaporware.\& Many thanks to the i3 folks for
providing such a great piece of software, so good that your users would rather
write an entirely new window manager from scratch that behaved \fIexactly\fR like i3
rather than switch to something else.\&
.P
You can run sway directly from a tty, or via a Wayland-compatible login manager.\&
.P
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
sway searches for a config file in the following locations, in this order:
.P
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'1.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 1. 4
.\}
~/.\&sway/config
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'2.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 2. 4
.\}
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config (suggested location)
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'3.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 3. 4
.\}
~/.\&i3/config
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'4.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 4. 4
.\}
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'5.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 5. 4
.\}
/etc/sway/config
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'6.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 6. 4
.\}
/etc/i3/config

.RE
.P
If unset, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to \fB~/.\&config\fR.\&
.P
An error is raised when no config file is found.\& The recommended default
configuration is usually installed to \fB/etc/sway/config\fR; you are encouraged to
copy this to \fB~/.\&config/sway/config\fR and edit it from there.\&
.P
For information on the config file format, see \fBsway\fR(5).\&
.P
.SH IPC COMMANDS
.P
Though \fBswaymsg\fR(1) is generally preferred, you may run \fBsway\fR \fIcommand\fR to
send \fIcommand\fR to the running instance of sway.\& You can also issue commands
with \fBi3-msg\fR(1) or even with \fBi3\fR(1).\&
.P
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.P
The following environment variables have an effect on sway:
.P
\fISWAYSOCK\fR

\fBsway-input\fR(5).\&
.P
.RE

.P
\fIDISPLAY\fR

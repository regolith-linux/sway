Description: i3-compatible Wayland compositor for the Regolith desktop environment
 sway (SirCmpwn's Wayland compositor) is a tiling Wayland compositor and a
 drop-in replacement for the i3 window manager for X11. It works with your
 existing i3 configuration and supports most of i3's features, plus a few
 extras. This means it is a minimalist, tiling window manager.  This variant
 supports trawl integration.
